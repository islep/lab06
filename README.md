# lab06

## Purpose
part1 takes a name as input, then concatenates it with itself and prints it. 

Group: Haiwei Hu and Benjamin Douglas.

We chose an MIT license because it allows people to do anything they want with the project.

We chose the Contributor Code of Conduct. Of the two default templates that GitHub suggested, the Contributor template is appropriate for projects of all size, while the alternative Citizen Code of Conduct is designed for large projects.

## Usage Instructions
The part1 file can be obtained by cloning or forking the repository. To use, we suggest opening part1 in a Jupyter environment. Run the program and type a string.

## Contributing
Should you want to contribute to this amazing project, consider forking and submitting a pull request.
